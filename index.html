					<h2 class="heading">Music Finding App</h2>
					<h3 class="subheading">Goal</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Make it easier for people to identify songs that they remember the name of. The basic premise of this app is a Shazam that works with other means of identifying music with a focus on humming, incomplete lyrics and non-official musical sources.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="subheading">Why I thought of it</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<img class="imgRight" src="images/notes-board.jpg">
						<p>
							Personally, I often find myself wondering where a snippet of a melody came from. This is especially true since some of the music I listen to is both not English and not available in the mainstream. The only person I have to turn to for answers is my sister; we somewhat have established a system where I’d text her the notes using letters, dots and dashes for rhythm.</p>
					</div>

					<h3 class="subheading">Potential Inspiration</h3>
					<ol class="text">
						<li><strong>Shazam</strong>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>The idea is basically a shazam that would work with people’s humming as well as official tracks. The simplicity of Shazam's UI is its best point. </li>
								<li>The con of Shazam is that it is reliant on official recordings.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Midomi</strong>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Searches user-contributed recordings to find the song. Users can help the next person looking for this song by singing it in the studio, recording and naming it.
								</li>
								<li>Incomplete archives, reliant on user-recordings, not mobile friendly</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Musipedia</strong>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Gives you the ability to play the tune with several note-related searches. These include a keyboard search (strictly notes), a contour search (the general note pattern of the song), using a flash piano, or a rhythm search which you can use to hunt for a song by rhythm alone. The Musipedia engine will convert it into a general “note-contour” line, and algorithmically run through its library of music looking for a match.
								</li>
								<li>Outdated UI that's not mobile friendly nor engaging.</li>

						Speculative Wall Painting App
					</h2>
					<h3 class="subheading">Goal</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Offer a way to envision murals without the permanent commitment. An app that allows people to draw on their mobile devices and then project said image onto any surface. Ideally, it would be made of four pieces that, when setup with requirements, create a 'canvas' of any size. Realistically, it's can simply be a companion app for a mini projector.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="subheading">Why I thought of it</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<img class="imgRight" src="images/interactive-wall.jpg">
						<p>It’s something out of a fantasy, futuristic movie that is actually just a simple luxury. As a child, I had always wanted to paint my room something intense and cool but my parents didn’t want me to touch the walls. I also wasn’t confident in my painting skills and how much I could commit to one theme. The product and app would allow kids to enjoy ‘drawing on the walls’ without the permanent cost. It’s also good for people who want to paint their walls but cannot decide what color they would want or how it would look. It makes customizing spaces easier</p>

					<h2 class="heading">Expiry Date App</h2>
					<h3 class="subheading">Goal</h3>
					<p>Reduce unnecessary grocery shopping and letting all of our food expire, contributing to food waste. An app that helps people keep track of what's in their fridge, the freshness of ingredients and propose solutions for ingredients that are going bad.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Why I thought of it</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>My parents love to grocery shop, buying whatever is on sale. Then, they come home to realize that they already have 3 more bags of corn in the freezer. Additionally, since we do not eat the same thing all the time, this surplus of ingredients are shoved to the back and left to rot. One of the most commonly asked questions in my house is "is it expired?" The same is said for leftovers. Sometimes, how long  We need a fridge or some form of method that will keep track of what we've bought and what should be eaten.</p>

					<h2>Week 2 <span class="subtitle">HMW Analysis + Statement of Intent</span></h2>
				</div>
				<p class="text">In the second week, we spent the class doing a How Might We workshop. We had to analyze the results and decide upon a project statement.</p>

					<button>+</button>
				
				<section class="hiddenContent">

					<h2 class="heading">How Might We Analysis</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>The “How Might We” Workshop was an exercise in pooling ideas about my topics from my peers. This encompasses either ‘how might we include’ to ‘how might we expand’. Overall, I found that while there were many points that I had already considered in my original idea proposal, there were also many other features that I had not considered. As I thought about integrating all the HMW functions, a clearer vision of the applications began forming.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Music Finding App <span class="subtitle">Summary</span></h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							The greatest challenge for the Music Finding App is the search function. There were many suggestions on how to improve and expand on a basic search as well as what to display within the results. One of the most crucial suggestions I received was to visualize the match and percentage. This shows whether or not the search is searching the correct melody, how effective the method is and allows users to compare similar melodies.<br>Other suggestions focused on integrating the service with existing music libraries and platforms to reduce the strain of migrating to a different music platform. This was already in my initial plans as the app would focus on giving answers to a search rather than serve as a hub for music. However, I did agree with the idea of fostering online communities to facilitate difficult searches or allow people to easily send snippets of searches or songs to their friends.
						</p>
					</div>
					<ol class="text">
						<li>Search
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Combine different types of search methods</li>
								<li>Account for different music skill levels</li>
								<li>Encourage users to improve search query</li>
								<li>Use genre, artist, album etc. to find music</li>

					</ol>

					<h3 class="subheading">Wall Painting App <span class="subtitle">Summary</span></h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Perhaps the features the Wall Painting app needs is a live version. Many HMW suggestions requested some form of live interaction whether it’s gesture-based navigation or live drawing. While I’m not sure how the semantics of having a purely interactive live screen where people may draw using gestures, I would definitely consider a collaborative mode. Initially, I had assumed that many users would draw on one device that could live cast the screen. However, the HMW has led me to explore multiple devices with multiple users sharing one ‘screen’ that can be cast live.<br>There were many suggestions involving AR or a more 3D approach. Despite how cool this could be, I’d like to focus on the 2D aspect and the multiple uses. For an interior design purpose, I believe 2D is sufficient in giving users an overview of what their walls may look like. A suggestion I really liked was being able to sample colours from surroundings. I do realize that many of the suggestions around simulating the environment (accommodating various lighting situations, real world colours etc.) would be reliant on the strength of the accompanying product and how it functions.

						<p><strong>What is the primary goal of your screen-based/application project?</strong></p>
						<p>
							The primary goal of my screen-based project is to allow users to easily display what’s on their screen onto any size flat surface.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Which medium/platform are you focusing on, and why?</strong></p>
						<p>
							I’m focusing on a tablet to projector medium because I assume that most people, when aiming to draw digitally in a flexible, would use their tablet due to its screen size and portability. A secondary medium is the phone which has become the central hub for all applications. The ‘projector’ is also an important platform since this is where the work will be projected on. As is recommended, there is a possibility that the projection is also interactive rather than a static image.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Keywords</strong></p>
						<p>
							Speculative, Projection, Live Art Installation, Interactive
						</p>

						<p><strong>Who is the intended audience?</strong></p>
						<p>
							The intended audience is children to young adult, geared towards the creative. The application’s primary goal is to project artwork onto surfaces without the permanent commitment of paint. A key component is the artwork, thus, it is initially targeted to those interested in viewing artwork on a larger surface. A secondary audience is the general public who may use the application for interior design or other display purposes. 
						</p>

						<p><strong>In which way will users be encouraged to use your interface over and over again?</strong></p>
						<p>
							The joy of the interface is in its simplicity and customizable options. This will allow the user to quickly achieve their end-goal (a projection of artwork of their choice) faster, leading to greater user satisfaction. Customization offers flexibility and the opportunity for multiple uses.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Based on your research and the How Might We workshop, what is the unique value proposition of your digital solution?</strong></p>
						<p>
							The Wall Painting App opens a variety of possibilities. It can be used by nearly anybody for any number of reasons-leisure, educational, interior design. Additionally, it is a great platform for collaborative art. In my ideal product scenario, the product would be scalable and lightweight as well.
						</p>

						<p><strong>How will you evaluate the success of your interface?</strong></p>
						<p>
							The learning curve for this speculative wall painting project should be very slight. The user should find joy in being able to see their work projected on a larger surface with ease and not be frustrated with the process. Since part of the targeted audience are young children, I would like for them to be able to easily use the app, with or without parental supervision and be awed.

					<h2>Week 3 <span class="subtitle">Crazy 8 + Wireframes</span></h2>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>During class, we split into two groups and performed a Crazy 8 workshop in which peers drew quick sketches of our chosen topic. I had trouble deciding which topic to proceed with but settled with the Wall Painting App as it was very speculative and open to many possibilities.</p>
				</div>

					<button>+</button>

				<section class="hiddenContent">
					<h2 class="heading">Crazy 8s</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>I found that the Crazy 8 workshop was quite helpful. It consolidated the intentions of the How Might We Workshop with potential ideas. By asking others to visualize what the interface may look like, I am given insight as to what they imagine is grouped together, what's necessary or what features should be available. This provides preliminary ideas while also bringing to light more How Might We's. The sketches also raised questions that help to narrow the final design. For example, for the Wall Painting App, I had to determine where the user interface and interaction would occur - in the application or in the projection. These two interfaces are very different and apply quite different experiences.</p>

						<p>While drawing my low-fidelity sketches, I had encountered obstacles on certain aspects of the application. I realized that there were many more features than I originally thought. My initial sketches included a carousel-style navigation, however, I quickly realized that it would not be the clearest way of organizing the app. I had to also revisit how the set-up process with the projector would occur, for the initial and every consequent time the projector is resized. This brought to my attention to consider how often features would be used and switched between. I also had to consider that every action must either be saved or discarded before proceeding.

							We presented our Figma prototypes to the class for feedback. I realized, after seeing the work of my peers, that a better approach to my mid-fidelity wireframes was to explore individual user flows. As I continued working on the prototype, I came across issues with understanding the steps for resizing the canvas. This made my realize that I had to step back and create a UX map to flesh out the user experience. The UX Map really helped me to visualize all the pages I needed, including error states, pop ups, and the overall functionality of the app. Also, I shifted to having a guided userflow as I realized how simpler it made planning and focusing on specific user experiences.

					<h2>Introducing DOTwall</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>As I created the mid-fidelity, I had to also create a 'language' for the application. I was deciding what tone I wanted the copy to have particularly for instructions, buttons and pop-ups. In the midst of this, I had to create terminology and an identity for the app. After some rough brainstorming, I settled on the name <strong>DOTwall</strong>. DOTwall is an abbreviation for Drawing On The Wall and uses the concept of the 4 points that make up the projection/screen. With the concept of wall, the art created in the app is referred to as paintings and users as artists. I used this language to cohesively tie the concepts together and establish a friendly tone for kids. I also maintained a mainly white color palette to compensate for the colorful paintings that will populate the dashboard.</p>
